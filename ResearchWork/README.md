# Research work code snippets

## Overview
[umap_csv.ipynb](umap_csv.ipynb) is a Python script developed as part of a research project under Dr. Kiran Vanaja aimed at mapping cellular gene expressions to cell surface protein markers. This script implements various data processing techniques, clustering, and dimensionality reduction methods to analyze and interpret complex biological data efficiently.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Implements techniques for cleaning and normalizing gene expression data.
- **Clustering**: Utilizes advanced clustering algorithms to group cells based on gene expression patterns and surface markers.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Employs techniques such as UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) to reduce the dimensionality of the data, facilitating its visualization and interpretation.

## Dependencies
To run `Umap_Csv.py`, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- SCANPY
- Scikit-learn
- UMAP-learn
- Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

You can install these dependencies using pip:
